# Book Search Engine (MERN Challenge)

## Overview

Welcome to the Book Search Engine, a project developed for the MERN Challenge. This application allows users to search for books, save them to their account, and manage their saved book list.

**Note:** This project is currently a work in progress, and it has several issues that need to be addressed. Below are some details about the current state of the project.

## Known Issues

The current codebase has several issues, and the application is not fully functional. Here are some of the known problems:

1. **Deployment Issues:**
   - Attempting to deploy the application to Apollo Server results in numerous errors.
   - Issues related to configuration and dependencies need further investigation.

2. **Authentication Logic:**
   - The authentication logic is incomplete and might not handle user authentication securely.
   - Enhancements and proper error handling are required.

3. **UI/UX Improvements:**
   - The user interface lacks polish and responsiveness.
   - Styling and layout improvements are needed for a better user experience.

## Future Updates

I acknowledge the current limitations of the project, and I plan to address them in future updates. Here is the roadmap for future improvements:

1. **Error Resolution:**
   - Investigate and resolve deployment issues with Apollo Server.
   - Ensure the application can be deployed successfully.

2. **Authentication Enhancement:**
   - Complete the authentication logic to ensure secure user authentication.
   - Implement proper error handling for authentication-related operations.

3. **UI/UX Refinement:**
   - Enhance the user interface with better styling and responsiveness.
   - Improve the overall user experience for a more intuitive interface.
